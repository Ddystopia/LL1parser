## Introduction

This is my first parser and I still writing him.
If you wanna help me, you'll can make a pull requests :3

## Using

You shoud provide your LL(1) (!!!!!) in src/Grammar.cpp.
In future I'll provide comfortable API and will make library from this.

If you change it tests will falling, in future i fix it
